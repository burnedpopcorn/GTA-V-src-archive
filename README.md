> [!NOTE]
>	It is recommended to create a virtual machine for this build process,<br>although the build process can be done on your Real PC.<br>
>       VMWare/Hyper-V are recommended to run the VM due to their performance.

## Prerequisite Setup
1. Install DirectX SDK June 2010 and 7-Zip
2. Install Visual Studio 2012
   - Uncheck all optional components in the installer **except "Microsoft Foundation Classes for C++"** to save space, none of them are needed for the build.
3. Install Update 4 for Visual Studio 2012
4. Install Incredibuild 4.0 (Only needed for compiling shaders and scripts)
   - If you encounter the error that the installer is "Blocked by your administrator", follow these steps:
   1. Hold Shift and right click the `incredibuild4_0.exe` file, select "Copy as path"
   2. Open Command Prompt as Administrator
   3. Paste the path and press Enter
   - Select to install "Incredibuild Agent", "Incredibuild Coordinator", and the extension for Visual Studio
5. Install OpenIV
6. Install Miscellaneous Files
8. Create X:\ drive by following these steps at the bottom
   1. Open Command Prompt
   2. Create a new folder called "GTA" to the Desktop 
   3. Run `net use X: \\localhost\c$\<Path to working folder for build> /persistent:yes`
       - Example: `net use X: \\localhost\c$\Users\abcd\Desktop\GTA /persistent:yes`
9. Create the folder `X:\gta5` and copy all folders from `GTAVSP.7z\GTA V Source` into it
   - By the end, you should have the folders `X:\gta5\src`, `X:\gta5\script`, and `X:\gta5\tools_ng`. If the paths are different or some folders are missing, try re-extracting or moving as needed.
10. Right click the folder `X:\gta5`, select "Properties", uncheck "Read-only", click Apply then OK
11. Copy all folders in `dll_patches.zip` to `X:\gta5\tools_ng\bin`, make sure to overwrite when copying
12. Open Command Prompt as Administrator and run the following commands, then close:
```batch
setx /m RS_TOOLSROOT X:\gta5\tools_ng
setx /m DXSDK_DIR "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft DirectX SDK (June 2010)"
setx /m RS_CODEBRANCH X:\gta5\src\dev_ng
setx /m RS_PROJECT gta5
```
12. To ensure changes are finalized, restart build machine.

## Patching The Source Code
1. Open `rush_patches-master.zip`
2. Copy `game` and `rage` folders to `X:\gta5\src\dev_ng`, make sure to overwrite when copying
3. (OPTIONAL) To skip launcher requirement for running the game, copy `game` and `rage` folders from `OPTIONAL_FIXES` to the same folder

## Building The Game Binary
1. Run `X:\gta5\src\dev_ng\game\VS_Project\load_sln_unity_2012.bat`
	- If prompted with "How do you want to open this file?", check "Always use this app to open .sln files" and click OK.
2. Once the solution loads, open the dropdown menu that says "Debug" at the top, select "Configuration Manager"
3. Change "Active Solution Platform" to "x64" and close the configuration window
4. Hold Ctrl key and click all projects under "GameLibs" and "Rage", right-click and select "Properties"
5. In the "Configuration" dropdown, select "All Configurations"
6. Select `C/C++ > All options`, under "Look for options or switches", search "err" and set "Treat Warnings as Errors" to "No (/WX-)", then click "Apply" and "OK"
   - For faster compiles, search "mul" and set "Multiprocessor Compilation" to "Yes (/MP)".
   - If you get the error `C1060: Compiler is out of heap space` during build, come back to the above setting and turn it off.
7. Right-click the "game" project and select "Properties" and do step 5 again
8. Change build the type at the top of the window from "Debug" to "BankRelease"
9. At the top of the window, select `Build > Build Solution` and wait for build to finish.
10. Copy output binary to game folder.

> [!NOTE]
> Building shaders and scripts can be skipped using the prebuilt files above. These steps are here to allow modding or for those who prefer to build from source as much as possible.

## Building Shaders
1. Under "Shaders", right click the "shaders_rc" project and click "Build"
    - If you building in "BankRelease", Dont forget to build shaders with "Release Win32 4.0" in **Configuration Manager**.
    - Also, the same thing needs to apply to "shaders_dependency", Change "Debug" to "Release" in **Configuration Manager**
    - **If you compiling with Debug, then ignore the steps at the top and continue reading the tutorial.**
2. (OPTIONAL) Build low quality shaders
   1. Right click the "shaders_rc" project and click "Properties"
   2. Select `Configuration Properties > NMake`
   3. Under "General", change all command lines from ending with `win32_40.bat` to ending with `win32_40_lq.bat`, then click "Apply" and "OK"
   4. Rebuild shaders
   3. Copy `X:\gta5\titleupdate\dev_ng\common` to game directory

## Building Game Scripts
1. Open Command Prompt
2. Run the following commands:
```batch
X:
cd X:\gta5\src\dev_ng
setenv
cd ..\..\tools_ng\bin\RageScriptEditor
ragScriptEditor
```
3. In the editor, select `File > Open Project` and open `X:\gta5\script\dev_ng\singleplayer\GTA5_SP.scproj`
4. Select `Compiling > Intellibuild > Build Project`

## Patching Game Assets
1. Run OpenIV, select "Windows"
2. Select the game folder and click "Continue"
3. Open `GTA V\update\update2.rpf\x64\levels\gta5\script`
4. Click the "Edit mode" button, and copy `X:\gta5\titleupdate\dev_ng\x64\levels\gta5\script\script.rpf` to the OpenIV window
5. [IMPORTANT] Fix Story Mode
	1. Open `GTA V\update\update.rpf\common\data` and make sure "Edit Mode" is enabled
	2. Under "XML Text Files", right-click `gameconfig.xml` and click "Edit"
	3. Under "Search", type "51000"
	4. Change the value of `51000` to `53000`
	5. Click "Save"
6. Close OpenIV
7. From `rush_patches-master.zip`, copy all files in the `ARCHIVEFIX` folder to a separate location
8. Open `<GAME FOLDER>\update`, and drag `update.rpf` and `update2.rpf` onto `ArchiveFix.exe`
9. Close both windows

## Running The Game
1. In the game directory, create a file named `launch.bat` and add these contents:
```batch
cd %~dp0
game_win64_bankrelease.exe -noSocialClub -nokeyboardhook -nonetlogs
```
2. (OPTIONAL) Add additional arguments:
 - `-kbgame` - Start game with game keyboard enabled.
 - `-output` - Show console log of game.
 - `-rag` - Enable support for RAG, the internal game debugging tool.
 - `-ragUseOwnWindow` - Use it with `-rag` parameter to make game run outside of RAG Render Window.
 - `-DoReleaseStartup` - Start real Story Mode on launch, Ignore if it says unknown parameter/command.
    - If you dont type this parameter, you will spawned in a random location as a random character with a random clothes. 
 - `-sc_DisableForbiddenVehicleRemoval` - This parameter allows DLC and Other Cars without getting removed.
    - If you using RAG, go to "Vehicles" tab and create widgets, after that Click "Creation Options" and turn on "Create as personal vehicle" to prevent game crashes. 
 - Additional standard game arguments can be added as well.
3. (OPTIONAL) Launch RAG with the following commands in Command Prompt
```batch
X:
cd X:\gta5\src\dev_ng
setenv
cd ..\..\tools_ng\bin\rag
rag
```
4. (OPTIONAL) If your game is from Steam, Copy [Goldberg](https://gitlab.com/Mr_Goldberg/goldberg_emulator/-/jobs/4247811310/artifacts/download) patch into game directory, make sure to overwrite
5. Run `launch.bat`
